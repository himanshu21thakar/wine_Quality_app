# üç∑ Wine Quality Classifier  

Predict wine quality using an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model trained on the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset). This app classifies wine as **Good (‚â•6)** or **Not Good (<6)** based on its chemical properties.

## üß† Project Overview  
This project applies machine learning to predict wine quality. The dataset includes 11 physiochemical properties such as acidity, residual sugar, sulphates, and alcohol. The model was trained with **SVM**, scaled with **StandardScaler**, and deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.
